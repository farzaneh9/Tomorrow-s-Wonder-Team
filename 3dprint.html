		     <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <h4>What is 3d printing?</h4>
            <br>
        <img src="img/3dPrint/3dprintingasharky.png" alt="" >
            <p>
            3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a transformative technology that involves creating three-dimensional objects layer by layer from a digital model. This process is fundamentally different from traditional manufacturing methods, which often involve subtracting material from a larger block to achieve the desired shape.

        </p>

        <p>
            In 3D printing, the journey from a digital design to a physical object begins with the creation of a digital model using Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software. This digital model is then sliced into thin, horizontal layers. The 3D printer then interprets each of these layers and sequentially builds the object by adding material layer upon layer until the final three-dimensional form is achieved.

        </p>

        <p>
            The materials used in 3D printing can vary widely and include plastics, metals, ceramics, resins, and even composite materials. The choice of material depends on the specific application and the desired properties of the final object.

        </p>

        <p>

        </p>

       <h4>
        how 3d printing works?
       </h4>
       <br>
       <p>
       <b>1. Digital Design Creation:</b>
       <br>
        The journey of 3D printing begins with the creation of a digital model using Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software. CAD allows designers and engineers to meticulously craft a virtual representation of the intended object. This digital model serves as a comprehensive blueprint, capturing every detail and dimension of the final product. The use of CAD empowers creators to conceptualize complex geometries and intricate structures, providing a level of precision and customization unparalleled in traditional manufacturing processes.
              
       </p>

       <p>
        <b>Slicing the Model:</b> 
        <br>
Once the digital model is finalized, it undergoes a process known as slicing. Slicing involves breaking down the 3D model into thin, horizontal layers using specialized software. Each layer represents a cross-section of the object. This step is crucial for the 3D printer to understand how to construct the physical object layer by layer. The thickness of these layers, known as the layer height, determines the level of detail and resolution in the final print. Smaller layer heights result in finer details but may increase printing time.

       </p>

       <p>
        <b>Layer-by-Layer Printing:</b>
        <br>
        
With the model sliced into layers, the 3D printer interprets this digital information and begins the layer-by-layer printing process. The print head, or extruder, moves along the predetermined paths, depositing or solidifying material according to the digital design. The choice of printing technology dictates the specific mechanism â€” it could involve melting and extruding plastic filaments (Fused Deposition Modeling or FDM), curing liquid resin with UV light (Stereolithography or SLA), or sintering powdered material with a laser (Selective Laser Sintering or SLS).
<p>This layering process is repeated until the entire three-dimensional object is realized. The ability to add material precisely where needed, with a high degree of complexity, sets 3D printing apart from traditional manufacturing methods.
</p>

       </p>
       <br>
<h4>
    Key Components of the 3D Printing Process:

</h4>
<p>
    <b>Print Bed:</b>
    <br>
The print bed is the foundation on which the object is built. It serves as the surface where the first layer adheres during printing. In many cases, the print bed is heated to ensure proper adhesion and prevent warping. A leveled and well-prepared print bed is crucial for the success of the print.

</p>
<p>
   <b>Extruder/Nozzle:</b> 
   <br>
The extruder, also known as the print head, is a critical component responsible for depositing or melting the material onto the print bed layer by layer. The nozzle determines the diameter of the extruded material, influencing the resolution of the print. In FDM printers, the extruder heats and extrudes thermoplastic filaments, while in other technologies, it may involve curing liquid resin or sintering powdered material.

</p>

<p>
    <b>Material:</b>
    <br>
3D printing materials vary widely, offering versatility to suit different applications. Common materials include various plastics (PLA, ABS), metals (such as titanium or aluminum), resins, and composite materials. The choice of material depends on the specific properties required for the final object, such as strength, flexibility, or heat resistance.

<h4>
    Project mile-stone, first 3d printed house in Netherlands
</h4>

<p>
    A consortium of the government, knowledge institutions and industry came together to develop the new technology with the dream of solving the housing shortage in the Netherlands. Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) conducted research and developed the BIM models to print. The concrete mortar needed for 3D printing was developed by Saint-Gobain Weber Beamix, and together with TU/e developed the printing technology. The municipality of Eindhoven co-initiated and facilitated the project.
    In recent years, 3D printing technology has overcome initial skepticism and demonstrated its viability, particularly in the construction industry. A significant milestone was reached on April 30, 2021, with the completion of the first 3D-printed concrete house in the Netherlands as part of the 'Milestone Project.' This single-story building, the first of five, fully complies with the country's strict construction requirements.

    The house, located in Eindhoven, boasts 94 square meters of floor space, including a living room and two bedrooms, designed to mimic the shape of a large rock, integrating harmoniously with the natural surroundings. The construction showcases the design freedom offered by 3D concrete printing. Notably, the house prioritizes comfort and energy efficiency, featuring extra-thick insulation and a connection to a heating network, resulting in an impressive energy performance coefficient of 0.25.

    One of the notable challenges faced by the construction team was printing the building's inclined walls. However, lessons learned from the prototype contributed to the mastery of this technique for the four planned subsequent buildings. The innovative aspect of 3D printing lies in its ability to place concrete precisely where needed, minimizing waste and optimizing sustainability.

    The advantages of 3D printing in construction include speed, efficiency, and the potential for customized designs. The Milestone Project aims to establish 3D concrete printing as a sustainable construction method, addressing housing deficits. According to Theo Salet, Professor of Concrete Structures at Eindhoven University of Technology, this marks a significant step toward transforming construction into a high-quality manufacturing industry, providing sustainable and affordable homes tailored to occupants' preferences.

<h4>G-Code</h4>
<p>
    <b>INTRODUCTION </b>
    <br>
G Code is a special programming language that is interpreted by Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines to create motion and other tasks. It is a language that can be quite complex at times and can vary from machine to machine. The basics, however, are much simpler than it first appears and for the most part follows an industry adopted standard. Mach4 has made a large leap closer to this standard. 
An important point to remember when reading this manual: In describing motion of a machine it will always be described as tool movement relative to the work piece. In many machines the work piece will move in more axes than the tool; however the program will always define tool movement around the work piece. Axes directions follow the right hand rule. 

</p>
<img src="img/3dPrint/right hand.jpg" alt="" style="width: 200px;">


<p>
    <b>Format </b>
    <br>
    In writing G Code programs there are some rules to be aware of as well as some general formatting guidelines that should be followed or at least considered. 
    <p>
       
        The first part of any program should be a safe start up block. This line of code is used to make sure that some modes are disabled and others are set to their most common setting. An example safe start block would look like this: 
       <br>
        G00 G90 G17 G54 G40 G49 G80 

    </p>
    

    <br>
    
    <p>
This block of code tells the machine that we want to be in rapid mode and using absolute position in the XY plane of fixture offset 1.  At the same time we want to cancel any tool diameter and length offsets and make sure any active canned cycles are cancelled.  
    <br>
G00 â€“ Rapid mode <br>
    G90 â€“ Absolute position mode <br>
    G17 â€“ XY plane select <br>
    G54 â€“ Fixture offset 1<br> 
    G40 â€“ Cutter compensation (tool diameter) cancel<br> 
    G49 â€“ Length offset cancel <br>
    G80 â€“ Canned cycle cancel <br>
   
    </p>
    
</p>
<p>
    It is recommended that this safe start block be used at the start of the program and also before or immediately following every tool change. It is common to restart a program from a tool change, having the safe start line there can greatly reduce the chance of a machine not acting as expected, the results of which can be aggravating at best and a crash at worst. The safe start block shown here is just an example. Every machine and every programmer are a little different and each will have their own start up block. 

</p>
<br>

<p>
    <h5>Code Descriptions </h5>
    Here there are the most common G code commands:
</p>
<p>
    <b>G00 â€“ Rapid move:</b> Rapid moves are used to move from point to point in free space, not cutting material. These moves do not require a feed rate input as they take place at max velocity of the machine. In absolute position mode (G90) X, Y and Z define the end point of the move in the user coordinate system. In incremental position mode (G91) X, Y and Z define the distance and direction to move from the current position. Format: G00 X__ Y__ Z__ 
</p>
<p>
    <b>G01 â€“ Linear Feed Move:</b> Linear feed moves are point to point moves in a straight line at a federate specified by F. The moves are interpolated so all axes in motion reach the end point at the same time. In absolute position mode (G90) X, Y and Z define the end point of the move in the user coordinate system. In incremental position mode (G91) X, Y and Z define the distance and direction to move from the current position. 
    Format: G01 X__ Y__ Z__ F__. 
    
</p>

<p>
    <b>G02/G03 â€“ Arc Feed Move:</b> Used to cut an arc at a federate specified by F. An arc is defined by its start and end points, its radius or center point, a direction, and a plane. Direction is determined by G02, clockwise, and G03, counterclockwise, when viewed from the planeâ€™s positive direction (If XY plane is selected look down so that the X axis positive direction is pointing to the right, and the Y axis positive direction is pointing forward).
</p>

<p>
    <b>G04 â€“ Dwell: </b>A dwell is simply a pause in the program. The duration of the dwell is specified by P in seconds. No machine movement will take place during a dwell. No auxiliary codes will be turned off, i.e. if the spindle is on it will stay on, coolant will stay on, etc.
    Format: G04 P__ 
    
</p>

<p>
    <b>G09 â€“ Exact Stop:</b> G09 is a non modal exact stop. Machine accelerations cause corners to be slightly rounded; when a true sharp corner is required G09 should be used. Although similar to G61 in function, G09 is not modal while G61 is. When G09 is included in a movement block, axis motion is decelerated to the end point of motion and the position is checked to be exactly as specified. This position check at the end of the move ensures that the machine actually reaches the desired position before moving onto the next block 
    Format: G01 G09 X__ Y__ F__ 
    
</p>
<p>
    <b>G10 â€“ Fixture and Tool Offset Setting:</b> It is possible to set fixture and tool offsets in the program. This can be very useful for programming multiple fixtures that have known zero points, multi pallet machines, applying automatic compensation of tool wear, and many other situations that require changing offset values. G10 is also one of the least understood G codes and is therefore underutilized. Changing offset values in a program requires a bit of cautiousness, a mistake can easily result in ruined parts and damaged tools. When used properly however, G10 can add flexibility and safety to a program and machine, especially with automation and lights out capacity or inexperienced operators. 
    Starting with fixture offset setting the G10 block will look like the following: 
    Format: G10 L2 P__ X__ Y__ Z__ A__ B__ C__ 
    
</p>

<p>
    <b>G12/G13 â€“ Circle Interpolation:</b> These codes are used to cut a circle using the current position as the center point. Words, I and J, define the radius of the circle and the lead-in direction. G12 will cut a circle in the clockwise direction and G13 will cut in the counterclockwise direction. It is also possible to cut a larger circular pocket by specifying Q for the start radius and P for the step over amount. This can be useful for cutting a circular pocket or an ID groove. 
Format 1: G12/13 I__ J__F__ 
Format 2: G12/13 I__ J__ P__ Q__ 

</p>

<p>
    <b>G17/G18/G19 â€“ Plane Selection:</b> Arcs, circles and drill cycles require the selection of a plane. The three axes X, Y and Z define three available planes XY, ZX, and YZ. The third axis defines the top of the plane, this axis is also known as the normal. Selection of a plane is done by specifying one of three G codes: G17 for XY, G18 for ZX and G19 for YZ. These are modal G codes and will stay active until another plane is selected or the system is reset. The default plane selection is G17.
</p>

<p>
    <b>G20/G21 â€“ Unit selection:</b> Programming units are selected using G20 for inch and G21 for millimeter. Use these G codes to specify the units in the program only; the setting will not affect Mach DROâ€™s, configuration settings, or offsets. 
</p>

<p>
    <b>G90.1/G91.1 â€“ Absolute/Incremental Arc Center Mode:</b> This setting affects arcs when programmed in the I, J, K format. In absolute arc center mode the I, J, K values designate the position of the arc center in the user coordinate system. In incremental arc center mode the I, J, K values designate the distance and direction to the arc center from the start point.
