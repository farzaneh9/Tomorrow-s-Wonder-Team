<h5>
    Biological Role and Importance
</h5>
Zinc is an essential trace element for humans, animals, plants, and microorganisms, necessary for prenatal and postnatal development. It is the second most abundant trace metal in humans after iron and appears in all enzyme classes. Zinc is also crucial for coral growth as it acts as an important cofactor for many enzymes. Zinc deficiency can lead to various health issues like growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, increased susceptibility to infection, and diarrhea in children. Excessive consumption of zinc may cause ataxia, lethargy, and copper deficiency.

</p>

<p>
    <h5>
Historical and Commercial Significance
    </h5>
Zinc metal production on a large scale started in the 12th century in India, though it was known to ancient Romans and Greeks. The oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar, in Rajasthan, as early as the 9th century AD. Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, has been used since the third millennium BC. Zinc is produced primarily by roasting sulfide ores, then leaching the oxidized product in sulfuric acid or smelting it in a blast furnace, and finally by electrolysis or condensation from blast furnace gas followed by distillation.

    <h4>Nonmetal 3: Silicon</h4>
    Silicon, symbolized as Si with atomic number 14, is a nonmetallic element that is second only to oxygen in abundance in the Earth’s crust. It is tetravalent, making four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds.
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/silicon"<img src="img/materials/12.png" alt="">></a> 
    This versatility allows silicon to form a wide range of compounds. Its common forms include crystalline silicon and amorphous silicon.
</p>

<br>

<p>
    <h5>Discovery and History</h5>
The discovery of Silicon is an intriguing tale. Initially, in 1787, Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier, a French chemist, identified the presence of silicon in rocks. However, it was mistakenly identified as a compound by Sir Humphry Davy in 1800. In 1811, French chemists Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis
Jacques Thénard likely prepared impure amorphous Silicon by heating potassium with silicon tetrafluoride. The credit for discovering silicon as a metal element is given to the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius in 1823. He extracted amorphous silicon in a similar manner to Gay-Lussac and then purified the elemental silicon by repeated cleaning. In 1824, in Stockholm, Berzelius obtained relatively pure silicon powder by heating potassium fluorosilicate and potassium. Hence, the honor of discovering silicon is attributed to Berzelius.

<h5>1. Plastic</h5>
<p>
<b>What Exactly Is Plastic?</b>
<br>Plastic is a widely used synthetic material derived from petrochemicals or other sources like cellulose. Chemically treated to form polymers, plastics can be molded into diverse shapes through techniques like injection molding. Known as resins too, plastics are popular for their versatility, durability, and cost-effectiveness. Various types such as polyethylene, polypropylene, PVC, PET, polystyrene, and nylon exist, each with distinct properties. Plastics fall into two main groups: thermoplastics, which can be remolded, and thermosets, which cannot be reprocessed when heated. The widespread use of plastic in modern society is attributed to its ease of manufacturing and low cost.

</p>

<p>
<b>What Is Plastic Made Of?</b>
<br>
Plastics are crafted from various polymers, both natural and synthetic, using constituents like coal, natural gas, cellulose, starch, crude oil, and salt. The primary methods for plastic production involve polymerization and polycondensation processes, necessitating specific catalysts. In polymerization, monomers like propylene and ethylene combine to create extended polymer chains. The resulting polymers exhibit unique sizes, structures, and properties determined by the specific monomers employed in the process.

<b>What Does a Plastic Look Like?</b>
<br>
Plastic can come in many different colors and textures, depending on the type of plastic and how it has been treated or processed. Plastic is a synthetic polymer made from various organic materials that can be molded into almost any shape. Some types of plastic are clear and transparent, like that used in disposable water bottles, while others are opaque and available in a range of colors. Plastic can also have different surface textures, ranging from smooth and shiny to rough and matte. Some types of plastic have soft and flexible textures, while others are rigid. Figure 1 below is an example of plastic:

 <b>What Are Different Types of Plastic?</b>
<p>1. Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET)</p>
<p>2. Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS)</p>
<p>3. Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC)</p>
<p>4. Polypropylene (PP)</p>
<p>5. Polyethylene (PE)</p>
<p>6. Polystyrene (PS)</p>
<p>7. Acrylic or Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA)</p>
<p>8. Polycarbonate (PC)   </p>
</p>
<br>

<p>
    <b>What Are the Physical Properties of Plastic?</b>
    <br>
The physical properties of plastic include:
<li>
    <b>Density:</b> Plastics come in many different densities, from as low as 0.9 g/cm³ for foamed plastics to as high as 1.5 g/cm³ for some engineering plastics.

</li>
<li>
    <b>Melting Point:</b> The melting points of plastics vary widely depending on the type of polymer. Some plastics have low melting points and can be easily molded while others have high melting points and require specialized processing techniques.

</li>
<li>
    <b>Hardness:</b> Plastics can range from soft and flexible to hard and rigid, depending on the specific polymer and its processing.

</li>
<li>
    <b>Transparency:</b> Some plastics are optically transparent while others are opaque and block light. Many transparent plastics can accept dye if you need them to be opaque.

</li>
<li>
    <b>Permeability:</b> Plastics can be permeable to gasses and liquids, which can be an advantage in some applications (such as food packaging) and a disadvantage in others (such as chemical storage).

</li>

</p>

<br>

<p>
 <b>What Are the Chemical Properties of Plastic?</b> 
 <br>Here are some common chemical properties of plastic:


<li>
    <b>Resistance to Chemicals:</b> Many types of plastic are resistant to industrial chemicals, acids, and other corrosive substances. This makes them useful in a variety of industrial applications.

</li>
<li>
    <b>Stability:</b> Some plastics are sensitive to heat, light, and radiation, which can cause them to degrade over time. UV stabilizers and antioxidants are often added to plastics to improve their stability.

</li>
<li>
    <b>Flammability:</b> Plastics can be highly flammable, and many of them release toxic gasses when burned. Flame retardants are often added to plastics to improve their fire resistance.

</li>
<li>
    <b>Degradation:</b> The rate at which plastics degrade depends on a variety of factors, including the type of plastic, the conditions to which they are exposed, and the specific environmental factors they encounter. Some plastics, such as polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), degrade very slowly so they will persist in the environment for hundreds of years. Other plastics, such as polylactic acid (PLA), are designed to be biodegradable and can break down much more quickly when exposed to moisture, heat, or microorganisms. Some plastics can undergo physical degradation, such as cracking or fragmentation, even if they do not break down chemically. This can be caused by sunlight, temperature changes, or mechanical stress, and can lead to the release of hazardous plastic particles called microplastics into the environment.

</li>
<li>
    <b>Solubility:</b> Each plastic has unique solubility characteristics. Plastics that are amorphous (not crystalline), like polystyrene and polycarbonate, are more soluble in typical organic solvents than crystalline ones. Certain highly crystalline polymers, including nylon and polyolefin, resist dissolution while others like polyvinyl acetate (PVA) are highly soluble in water.

</li>
<li>
    <b>Reactivity:</b> Plastics can be reactive in different ways, depending on their chemical composition. For example, polyethylene reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water while polypropylene is relatively unreactive and stable in most chemical environments.

</li>
<li>
    <b>Biodegradability:</b> Some plastics, such as polyethylene, are not biodegradable and can persist in the environment for hundreds of years. Others, such as polycaprolactone (PCL), are biodegradable and can be broken down by bacteria and fungi over time.

</li>
<li>
    <b>Recyclability:</b>  Plastics can be difficult to recycle since they each have different chemical compositions and properties. Some types of plastics are easier to recycle than others, and recycling methods vary depending on the type of plastic.

</li>

  
</p>

<p>
For our project we decided to go with the “Polyethylene (PE)” for it’s strenght and flexibility as well the low costing manufacturing process.
Polyethylene (PE) stands as the most prevalent polymer globally, with an annual production of 85 million metric tons, owing to its extensive utility. Classified by melting points, it encompasses low, medium, and high-density variants, each finding distinct industrial applications. These include High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Ultra Low-Density Polyethylene (ULDPE), Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (LLDPE), Medium-Density Polyethylene (MDPE), High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (HMWPE), and Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE).

</p>

<p>
Historically, polymerization occurred under high pressure and temperature, but advancements led to energy-efficient catalytic systems like Ziegler and metallocene. These catalyst families enable copolymerization, yielding a diverse range of PE resins. The production methods involve slurry, gas-phase fluidized bed reactors, or their sequential combination, such as the Spherilene and Borstar processes. Slurry-phase polymerization utilizes double-tube loop reactors or autoclaves with catalysts and diluents. An example is the Borstar process, employing a Double-Tube Loop Reactor followed by a gas-phase reactor. These innovations have optimized energy efficiency in PE production over time.

<h5>3. Rubber</h5>
<p>
<b>What is Rubber?</b>

<li>Rubber is a highly elastic, or “super-stretchy” solid substance most commonly used in rubber bands, tires, seals, and gaskets.
</li>
<li>Rubber materials are called Elastomers or “elastic polymers” due to the material’s excellent elongation, deformation, and instantaneous recovery from stretching or compression.
</li>

<p>
 There are two types of rubber:
<li>Natural Rubber – which is derived from a runny, milky white liquid called Latex, that oozes from certain plants when you cut into them.
</li>
<li>Synthetic Rubber – which is made in chemical plants and laboratories using petrochemicals as their starting point.
</li>
<li>In its original form, natural rubber has limited usefulness. The early uses of natural rubber were limited by the fact that it was sticky when hot, and brittle when cold.  To develop the toughness and strength that we normally associate with rubber parts, we must crosslink or vulcanize the rubber molecules.
</li>
<li>There are several ways to crosslink rubber, but the most common is using sulfur. Sulfur, with the addition of heat and pressure, will crosslink rubber.  Crosslinking (or vulcanizing) connects all the long individual polymer chains into a single unit.
