                    In the quest for creating meaningful and impactful designs, our team embarked on a mission to address one of the most pressing issues faced by Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs): access to clean and portable water. 
                    <p>
                    The result of our collaborative efforts is the Aqua Barrel, a revolutionary solution designed to ease water transportation challenges and provide communities with a reliable source of purified water.

                    LCDs often grapple with the arduous task of transporting water from distant sources to their communities. Furthermore, the water obtained is frequently contaminated, leading to widespread health issues. Recognizing this predicament, our team sought to develop an innovative solution that not only simplifies water transportation but also ensures that the water is safe for consumption.

                      Despite the fertility rate decreasing in less developed countries (LDCs) since the 1980s, their populations are still growing rapidly. From 2015 to 2020, the average number of children per woman in LDCs was four, while the global average was 2.5. Due to increased life expectancy without a corresponding decline in fertility, LDCs have an estimated population growth rate of 2.3%, twice the world average of 1.1%.
                      </p>
                       <p>
                     However, LDCs face challenges as they lack rapid improvements in productivity and employment. This rapid population growth increases the pressure on natural resources, hindering the achievement of a demographic dividend – a boost in economic growth resulting from demographic changes.

                      <h5>climate change:</h5> 
                    The October-December 2022 season marked the fifth consecutive failed rainfall season, with both short and long rains falling below average since 2020. This resulted in the worst drought in 40 years (WMO, 2022, FAO 2022). The drought caused significant issues like harvest failures, poor pasture conditions, livestock losses, reduced surface water, and human conflicts, affecting 4.35 million people who require humanitarian aid (NDMA, 2022). Over 180,000 refugees from Somalia and South Sudan sought refuge in the drought-affected regions of Kenya and Ethiopia (UNHCR).

                      <h5>Turbidity Sensor</h5> 
                      A turbidity sensor is a device that measures the cloudiness or haziness of a liquid, typically referring to the presence of suspended solids like silt, algae, or microorganisms. It works by using light to detect the amount of scatter caused by these particles in the liquid. Here's a breakdown of its key aspects:

                <p>
                  The idea of the Q Drum originated in response to the needs of rural people in Southern Africa who struggle conveying adequate quantities of potable water from a reliable source. A task generally bestowed on the women and children of each community. Q Drum addresses the problem of reducing the load yet increasing volume by rolling water in a cylindrical vessel.

Additionally, accessibility is not only related to pricing but also encompasses distribution channels, ensuring the product is readily available through various means such as local retailers, online platforms, or collaborations with community organizations. A product's success hinges on its ability to be both affordable and easily accessible, enabling it to meet the diverse needs of consumers and communities grappling with water scarcity or quality issues.

                  <p>
                    <b>First Scenario - Water Transport Ease:</b> <br>
As I wake up in my village, the realization hits that fetching water for daily use involves a long and strenuous journey. Carrying a large amount of water is not only heavy but also exhausting. However, with the Roll-Aqua Barrel, the task becomes remarkably easier. I assemble the barrel, and instead of lifting the weight, I simply roll it effortlessly to the distant water source. The convenience of dragging or rolling the barrel minimizes the physical strain, making water transportation a much more manageable and efficient process.

                  <p>
                    <b>Second Scenario - Purification at the Source:</b> <br>
Living in an area where drinkable water is inaccessible, I find myself near a river, a potential source of water. However, the water in the river is not safe to drink. With the Roll-Aqua Barrel, equipped with an integrated water purification system, I can collect water from the nearby river without worry. The filtration system ensures that any water source, no matter how impure, can be turned into safe and drinkable water right at the point of collection, providing a vital solution to water scarcity.

              <p>
                <b>Third Scenario - Selective Water Usage:
                </b>
<br>
                After collecting water from the river, I realize that I don't need to purify all of it for my daily use. The Roll-Aqua Barrel comes to the rescue with its innovative design. I open the separate lid dedicated to non-purified water, allowing me to use the collected water without passing it through the purification system. This thoughtful feature not only conserves energy but also ensures that resources are used judiciously according to specific needs.
