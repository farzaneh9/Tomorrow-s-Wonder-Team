                <h3>Arduino IOT</h3>
       <p>
       <h4>Internet of Things (IOT)</h4> 
  
</p>
<p>
 The Internet of Things (IoT) is a transformative concept that involves connecting everyday objects to the internet, allowing them to collect and share data. This interconnection facilitates enhanced efficiency and intelligence in diverse domains, from smart homes and industrial systems to healthcare and agriculture. IoT devices, equipped with sensors and actuators, communicate via various protocols, enabling seamless interoperability. The data generated by these devices undergoes processing, often employing advanced analytics and edge computing, to derive meaningful insights.
 <p>
 Security and privacy considerations are crucial due to the sensitive nature of IoT data. The scalability and diverse applications of IoT, ranging from smart cities to wearables, underscore its potential to revolutionize how we interact with our surroundings and leverage technology for improved experiences and outcomes. Despite facing challenges, the ongoing evolution of IoT holds the promise of creating interconnected ecosystems that respond intelligently to changing conditions and user needs.

<p>
  <h5>IOT development board</h5>
 IoT boards are useful hardware structures that we use to prototype a new IoT project. Custom hardware results is expensive to design and manufacture, and development boards come to the rescue to avoid that.
<p>
Regarding IoT development boards, they mainly refer to development boards with WiFi and Bluetooth functions. Although some development boards do not have Wi-Fi function, you can also add a Wi-Fi module to realize the networking function. There are mainly Arduino, Esp8266, Esp32, Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi Zero W, etc. on the market.
</p>
<p>
 What is more common now is Espressif 's esp32 series. For example, Xiaomi's smart socket uses Espressif's Esp32 solution. The Esp32's capability to enable wireless communication, its relatively low power consumption, and its compatibility with a range of sensors make it well-suited for diverse IoT projects and contribute to its popularity in the development community.

<img src="img/iot/43.png" alt="">  

<p>
9.	Give a switch name and choose Datastream that we created earlier
</p>
<img src="img/iot/45.png" alt="">  

<p>
10. Save the Widget Box
</p>
<img src="img/iot/46.png" alt="">  


<p>
11.	Next you have to add device. Go to Devices to add a new device
</p>
<img src="img/iot/47.png" alt="">  


<p>
12.	When you click on New Device you have to choose a way. Here we will choose From template
</p>
<img src="img/iot/48.png" alt="">  

<p>
13.	Choose the template that you have created
</p>
<img src="img/iot/50.png" alt="">  

<p>
14.	After choosing template you can check Device info and Firmware configuration (Template ID, Template Name, and AuthToken should be declared at the very top of the firmware code). You need to copy the Firmware Configuration code.
</p>
<img src="img/iot/51.png" alt="">  

<p>
15.	Next we need to go to Arduino IDE for uploading code for controlling the led. First choose esp8266 board and port COM4 (When you connect the cable with NodeMcu board). 
</p>
<img src="img/iot/74.png" alt="">  

<p>
16.	Copy this code and paste 
<pre>
  <code>
    #define BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID "TemplateID"
    #define BLYNK_DEVICE_NAME "Device Name"
    #define BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN "Auth Token"
    
    
    #define BLYNK_PRINT Serial
    #include &lt;ESP8266WiFi.h&gt;  
    #include &lt;BlynkSimpleEsp8266.h&gt;
     
    
    char auth[] = BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN;
    char ssid[] = "Wifi Username";  // Enter your Wifi Username
    char pass[] = "Wifi Password";  // Enter your Wifi password
    
    int ledpin = D4;
    void setup()
    {     
      Serial.begin(115200);
      Blynk.begin(auth, ssid, pass);    
      pinMode(ledpin,OUTPUT);
    }
    
    void loop()
    {
      Blynk.run(); 
    } 
  </code>

<br>


<p>
17.	You just need to change your Firmware Configuration code that you got from Blynk and change User name and Password.  
</p>
<img src="img/iot/75.png" alt="">  


<p>
18.	After that make sure you connect NodeMcu Esp8266 with cable then upload the code on NodeMcu Esp8266.
</p>
<img src="img/iot/76.png" alt=""> 

<p>
19.	After you successfully upload the code then go to Blynk Device and check Dashboard to find your device Online. Now, you can use the Led switch to control the Led (Turn it on and off).

   </video> 
 </p>


<p>
20.	For Blynk Cloud we can control hardware using Mobile as well. First you can download Blynk Mobile app on Android or iOS.
</p>
<img src="img/iot/Weixin Image_20240103200301.jpg" alt=""> 

<p>
 21.	After you download the app you just need to login to your Blynk Account. Next you can find your template on there just have to add a widget button for Led.
</p>
<img src="img/iot/Weixin Image_20240103200302.jpg" alt=""> 
 
<p>
22.	Add Button to control Led
</p>
